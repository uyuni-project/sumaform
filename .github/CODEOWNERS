# CODEOWNERS info & syntax
# Lines starting with "#" are comments.
#
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more owners.
#
# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence.
#
# Owners can be specified by email address or GitHub username
#
# Teams can be specified as code owners as well. Teams should
# be identified in the format @org/team-name. Teams must have
# explicit write access to the repository.
#
# Patterns
#
# Whole repository
# * @global-owner
#
# Directory (without subdirectories)
# docs/* @tech_writer
#
# Directory (including subdirectories)
# apps/ @app_developer
#
# Adding a leading "/" to a pattern means the directory must
# be in the root of the repository.
#
# Empty Pattern -> no owner (@app_developer owns all of apps/ except apps/github)
# apps/ @app_developer
# apps/github

# Sumaform Code Owners

# Owners of the codebase
* @uyuni-project/sumaform-developers

# Workflows reviewers
.github/workflows @uyuni-project/workflows-reviewers
